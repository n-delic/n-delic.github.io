## Introduction

After my aftermarket Android car radio failed, I decided to simplify things and reinstalled the original VW RCD 310 radio in my car. To stream music, I relied on an FM transmitter. However, as someone who enjoys discovering new music through random playlists, I found the lack of song titles displayed on the radio frustrating. My current FM transmitter doesnâ€™t support showing track information. After learning that the Radio Data System (RDS) feature is available on FM radio, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build a custom ESP32-based FM transmitter that could transmit both audio and song details.
